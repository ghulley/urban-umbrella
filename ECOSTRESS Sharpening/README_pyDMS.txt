To use the downscaling algorithm to upsample ECOSTRESS from 70m to Sentinel 2 resolution (20m or 10m), please refer to the tutorial named "Setting_up_for_sharpening".  
If you already have VS Code and a working environment, skip these parts in the tutorial.
More ECOSTRESS tutorials are soon going to be available on a separate GitHub.
